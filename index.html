<h2>​Compliance with Google Play Families Policy (Mixed Audience):</h2>
<p>​Because our App is intended for a mixed audience (including children and older users), we implement technical measures to protect child users and comply with the Google Play Families Policy and the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). <br>
    <b>​Age Gating:</b> Users are prompted to enter their age upon first use. ​<br>
    <b>Child User Handling:</b> If a user is identified as being under the age of consent (e.g., under 13), we take the following steps: ​
    <b>Non-Personalized Ads Only:</b> We instruct our advertising provider(s) (e.g., Google AdMob) to serve only non-personalized ads to that user, which means no personal data (like the Advertising ID) is used for ad targeting.
    <br><b>Data Restriction:</b> We restrict the transmission of persistent identifiers (like the Android Advertising ID and other device identifiers) for advertising purposes for child users, as required by Google Play policy. 
    <br><b>​Ad Network Certification:</b> Any advertising SDKs used in this App are certified by the Google Play Families Self-Certified Ads SDK Program. </p>
<p>Specifically, we use Google AdMob for advertising. By using the Service, you consent to the use of the following data for ad personalization:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Advertising Identifier (AAID)</li>
<li>Usage Data</li>
<li>IP Address (used to infer general location)</li></ul>
​<br><b>How to Opt-Out of Personalized Ads:</b>
<p>Users can opt-out of interest-based ads by enabling the 'Opt out of Ads Personalization' setting on their Android device. We honor this setting as required by Google Play policy.</p>
